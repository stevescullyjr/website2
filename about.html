<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a Founder and Chairman of Thaddeus Medical Systems, Inc (TMSI), I have leveraged my M.D. / Ph.D. and turned towards entrepreneurship to prevent medical errors in Clinical Pathology and Clinical Pharmacology. On a personal note, I married my best friend from the Jesuit Volunteer Corps and have 3 amazing boys. I love going to Church on Sunday with them, and playing Racquetball at the athletic club when possible. </p>
